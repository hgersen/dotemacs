#+TITLE: Emacs Configuration

This is an experiment to create an Emacs configuration with a [[https://www.vim.org][Vim]] style editing grammar without
using [[https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/Evil][Evil mode]]. It maintains Vim's concept of text object, operations and grammar, but doesn't use
the same keybindings. These reflects changes that are needed to have home row navigation using
~knei~ as I use the [[https://colemakmods.github.io/mod-dh/][Colemak mod-DH]] keyboard layout

* Core ideas
This configuration uses the [[https://github.com/Kungsgeten/ryo-modal][ryo-modal]] package to set up a modal configuration in the form of a minor
mode in combination with [[http://spacemacs.org/][spacemacs]] like transient modes using [[https://github.com/abo-abo/hydra][hydra]]. This allows me to create my own
bindings that can be bound to a sequence of characters of my own choosing instead of having to fight
~Evil~.

To ensure that this configuration is reproducible between different machines packages are
installed and managed using [[https://github.com/raxod502/straight.el][straight.el]], which integrates well with [[https://github.com/jwiegley/use-package][use-package]].

* Credits
A large part of the code in this repo is based on the Emacs configation of [[https://github.com/sriramkswamy/dotemacs][sriramkswamy]], who has
implemented this for a qwerty keyboard layout.
